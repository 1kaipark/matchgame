# Match Game
* This is a clone of Quizlet's old "Match" mode, which has recently been replaced with "MicroMatch". AFAIK there is no way to bring back the old drag and drop Match game, so I made this here.

## Use:
* Simply import .CSV files using the 'Load Deck' button.
  * CSVs must follow the format
  ```
  term,definition
  ```
* Settings:
  * Params are self-explanatory, make sure that the font sizes are integer values (they will be automatically parsed).
  * 'positioning' is either 'grid', for the MicroMatch grid layout, or 'random', for the old drag and drop game.

## TODOS:
* Make everything prettier
* Can't handle super long single words. Not sure if this is even worth fixing but perhaps
* Image support
  ```
  ```
